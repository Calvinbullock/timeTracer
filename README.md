# TimeTracer - Chrome Extension for Tracking Website Usage

## This is a chrome extension that will track a users time on individual websites and communicate that time back to the user.

## Features
- All data is stored localy and not sent anywhere.
- Records time spent on all sites visited.

### Planned features
- Can flag / block URLs to redirect and keep you off that particular site
- See multiple days
- add sites that you don't want to see time on

## File Layout
- pkg/      -- The code in it's production script files
- src/      -- The source code in its files for testing and building (the html / css is only in pkg/popup)
- test.sh   -- This will run all the test files / scripts
- build.sh  -- This will parse all my src files into the production script files
- watch.sh  --  TODO: this is similar to nodemon, it will watch the src files and rebuild production on change
- todo.sh   -- a script that will print all `TODO:` to the console from `src/`

## Install Instructions
