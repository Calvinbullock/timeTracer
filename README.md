This is a chrome extension that will track a users time on individual websites and communicate that time back to the user.

## Features:

- All data is stored locally in chrome local and not sent anywhere else.
- Records time spent on all sites visited.
- Shows data from yesterday and averages for the last 7 days.

### Planned features:

- Can flag / block URLs to redirect and keep you off that particular site.
